The syntax of this command is: exec-timeout minutes [seconds]\nTherefore we need to use the \"exec-timeout 30\" command to set the user inactivity timer to 30 minutes. To set the user inactivity timer to 30 seconds we use the\n\"exec-timeout 0 30\".\nReference:\nhttp://www.cisco.com/c/m/en_us/techdoc/dc/reference/cli/nxos/commands/fund/exec-timeout.html",
